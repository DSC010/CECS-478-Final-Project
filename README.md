# Tamper‑Evident Logs (Option 6) – Milestone 1

This repository is the Milestone 1 skeleton for a Python‑based tamper‑evident logging system.
Implementation will be added in later milestones.

## Quick Start

Run:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

This creates a virtual environment and installs minimal dependencies so the project
is ready for development in future milestones.
