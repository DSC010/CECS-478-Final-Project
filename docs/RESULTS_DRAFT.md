# Draft Results – Tamper-Evident Logging Evaluation

## 1. Dataset and Methodology

For this phase, all logs are **synthetic** to avoid handling real user data.

- Logs are generated by running:
  - `make demo` (end-to-end sample run)
  - Additional local runs of `write_log.py` with different messages and levels.
- Each log entry includes:
  - Timestamp (`ts`)
  - Level (`level`)
  - Message (`msg`)
  - Extra metadata (`extra` dict)
  - `prev_hmac` and `hmac` forming a hash chain.

The primary dataset used in this draft is:

- `artifacts/release/app.log`

Summary metrics are exported as:

- `artifacts/release/log_summary.json`
- `artifacts/release/log_summary.csv`

## 2. Initial Observations

From the CSV/JSON summaries:

- The log contains a small but representative mix of events (e.g., startup, demo actions, completion).
- Most entries are logged at the `INFO` level, matching expectations for a normal, non-error scenario.
- The total number of entries matches the number of application events in the demo sequence, confirming that no entries are silently dropped.

This demonstrates that:

- The logger is correctly capturing each synthetic event.
- The summarizer accurately reflects the distribution of log levels.

## 3. Tampering Detection Behavior

In unit tests and manual experiments, the verifier detected:

- **Content edits**:
  - Changing a message body in the second entry caused a `hmac mismatch` at the modified index.
- **Wrong secret key**:
  - Re-verifying a clean log with a different HMAC key caused verification to fail, as expected.

In all tested scenarios so far:

- Clean logs verify successfully (`ok=True`).
- Tampered logs fail quickly and report the first bad index, which is important for forensics and debugging.

## 4. Planned Next Steps

For the final phase, evaluation will be extended to:

1. **Larger Logs**
   - Generate logs with hundreds or thousands of entries.
   - Measure verification time as log size increases.
   - Compare overhead vs. standard JSON logging without chaining.

2. **Additional Attack Types**
   - Deletion of entries in the middle of the log.
   - Insertion of fabricated entries.
   - Reordering of segments.
   - Truncation and partial trailing corruption.

3. **More Detailed Metrics**
   - Time to verify per N entries.
   - Ratio of INFO/WARN/ERROR in realistic scenarios.
   - Number of logs that fail verification under different synthetic attack patterns.

These results will be summarized in updated CSV files and, if time allows, simple charts or tables for the final report.
